# Code Style Guide

This programming style guide is intended to provide guidelines for writing clear, maintainable, and consistent code for the data science project investigating the impact of the 2022 ASUU strike on academic performance at the University of Lagos. This guide covers the Python programming language.

## Naming Conventions

1. Use meaningful and descriptive variable names that reflect their purpose.
2. Variables, functions, and file names should use lowercase letters separated by underscores.
3. Use singular nouns for variables that represent a single item and plural nouns for variables that represent collections of items.
4. Include a variable type if there are multiple variables with the same name but different datatypes.
5. Class names should use PascalCase.

## Formatting Guidelines

1. Use four spaces for indentation.
2. Avoid lines longer than 79 characters.
3. Use blank lines to separate code blocks logically.
4. Use whitespace judiciously to make code more readable.

## Documentation Standards

1. Use comments to explain code logic and reasoning.
2. Use docstrings to document functions and classes.
3. Use clear and descriptive variable names that make it easy to understand their purpose.

## Best Practices

1. Follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python coding.
2. Use version control to track changes and collaborate with team members.
3. Write unit tests to verify the correctness of functions and methods.
4. Use meaningful variable names that make the code self-documenting.
5. Avoid magic numbers and define them as constants instead.

## Regular Review and Revision

This style guide should be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the project. Team members are encouraged to provide feedback and suggest revisions to ensure that the style guide remains relevant and effect.
